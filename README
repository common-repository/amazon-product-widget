This plugin provides a multi-widget, which displays a random product (like a book) from a given list of Amazon product numbers (ASIN).

== Description ==
This plugin provides a sidebar widget to display a random product from a list of ASINs or a single product. The plugin 
makes use of the Amazon Web-Service (AWS) to retrieve detailed data of a product. The plugin supports HTML-Templates to
display the product and makes use of a simple caching functionality. So the data is only requested once.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory
3. Activate the plugin
4. Configure the plugin (Region, Associate-ID, AWS public key and AWS private key)
5. Drag widget to a sidebar
6. Enter "Title" and a "List" of Amazon product ASIN numbers and optional edit the HTML-template

Important:
The plugin does not work without an Amazon Associate-ID!

== Frequently Asked Questions == 
Q: 
I tried to install the Amazon Product Widget-Plugin and am getting the following error while trying to save configuration:
file_get_contents() failed. Please ensure that PHP's native function file_get_contents() is allowed to read URL's
Configuration could not be saved!

A:
The Amazon Product Widget make use of the PHP function "file_get_contents()" to read data from the Amazon API. 
But sometimes the default PHP configuration (php.ini) does not allow to read URLs due to security reasons. 
Change the value of "allow_url_fopen" to "1". 
More information about this issue: http://www.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-fopen
